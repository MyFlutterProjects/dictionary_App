# dictionary_app
## Concept
- Getting api data and diplaying it on the screen.
- Using Stream builder.

## Streambuilder 
- this was thenew key concept I learnt in this project. 
- Stream builder rebuilds widget whenever it gets data 

## Appbar
- bottom feature of the appbar that enables us to add widgets and in this project we used it to add a search input .

## Debounce 
Helps us to time events, in this project it is used to execute a search if a user poses for one second after typing in some characters, so u may not need to tap search.

I have liked this project, it is simple but cool!
